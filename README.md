**Tensorflow GUI has been officially renamed to Neural Studio.**

# Neural Studio 

> Neural studio is a rapid prototyping tool for deep learning applications. It provides and easy to use and intuitive UI for users ranging from beginners to professionals.

### Progress And Features

---
☑️ : Implementation Partial

✅ : Implementation Complete

---

✅ Re-design and re-implement UI in React and Python based backend framework and move the application to the web. 

✅ Removing dependencies like konvajs and creating a Graph editor from scratch. 

✅ Add support for keras APIs. 

✅ Ready to use pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, etc. These can be used for transfer learning. 

✅ Create an in-browser training and testing environment. 

✅ Develop utilities to monitor training process, monitor live loss and visualize them using line plots. 

✅ Add support for custom functions as nodes that can be used to inject code in graph.

☑️ Develop an Inference engine for trained models to run models and utility to visualize outputs for simpler models like classification, regression segmentation etc. 

☑️ Add custom data loaders and a dataset viewer for different input type of data. Eg. images, text files.

☑️ Add support for saving , loading and sharing training models in different formats such as .pb , weights and json files. 

✅ Add preprocessed open source datasets from different domains.

> These are features that i proposed as part of my GSoC proposal. I have also added severl more features like cross platform distribution using PyPi, Public Inference APIs for trained models and Workspace management.
